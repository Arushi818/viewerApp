# Viewer Webapp

## About the viwer:

### Background information:

- The viewer loads a 3D model of the Apollo 11 Spaceship and allows the user to interact with it by zooming in and out using the buttons or
their cursor. The model can also be rotated by dragging the cursor. 


### How To Run:
__Steps:__
1. Open the folder with VS Code
2. Run the viewer.html file using the live server extension, either by selecting "Open with Live Server" option when right clicking on the file in the explorer or by opening the .html file and right clicking on that screen.
  
#### Note:
  1. Sometimes, the model file runs into loading issues, which results in missing textures and colors on the display. The issue has only happened once, just with models from the Smithsonian 3D Digitization website. In case this issue arises, follow the instructions as indicated in the comments in the viewer.js file to replace the model with one from another website.

  2. Please run the program as indicated in the readme.
